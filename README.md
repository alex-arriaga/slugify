# Slugify

## Summary

Slugs are usually a URL friendly version of a content title 
Slugs are meant to be used with permalinks as they help describe 
what the content at the URL is.

e.g. instead of using these kinds of URLs:

```
http://www.alex-arriaga.com/posts/24
```

It is better to use:
```
http://www.alex-arriaga.com/learning-functional-programming-with-javascript-jsunconf-2016/
```

## The tool

This application allows to create slugs that can be copied and pasted in
your favorite Content Management System when creating content.
