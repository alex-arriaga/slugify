# Slugify

Demo: [https://alex-arriaga.com/slugify/](https://alex-arriaga.com/slugify/).

## Summary

Slugs are usually a URL friendly version of a content title. 
Slugs are meant to be used with permalinks as they help describe 
what the content at the URL is.

e.g. instead of using these kinds of URLs:

```
http://www.alex-arriaga.com/posts/24
```

It is better to use:
```
http://www.alex-arriaga.com/learning-functional-programming-with-javascript-jsunconf-2016/
```

## The tool

This application allows to create slugs that can be copied and pasted in
your favorite Content Management System when creating content.

## About me

I am curious person, I am always eager to learn how to improve what I do.

I love computer sciences and consider myself passionate about research and 
its application to any aspect of life. 

I am proud to be Mexican because I love Mexico's prehispanic cultures. In my spare time, I impart workshops 
by streaming for the developer community from throughout Latin America and I read scientific articles 
about computer sciences and its application to Medicine and Biology.
